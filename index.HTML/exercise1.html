        <P>You'll need this tag at the beginning of every HTML document you create.It ensures that a browser knows that it's reading HTML, and that it expect HTML5, the lasted version.</P>
        <br/>
        <p>Even though this isn't actually an HTML tag, it's still a good one to know.</p>
        <br/>
    <h2>2.&lt;html&gt;</h2>
    <hr color="black" size="5">
    <br/>
    <p>This is another tag that tells a browser that it's reading HTML.The&lt;html&gt;tag goes straight after the DOCTYPE tag, and you closeit with&lt;/html&gt;tag right at the end of your file. Everything else in your document goes between these tags.</p>

    <h2>3.&lt;head&gt;</h2>
    <hr color="black" size="5">
    <br/>
    <p>The &lt;head&gt;tag starts the header section of your life.The stuff that goes in here doesn't appear on your web page. Instead, it contains metadata for search engines,and info for your browser.</p>
